# Numerical_Methods
Repository created for the project of Numerical Methods (if816)

Features and Description:
  * The purpose of the project is to solve differential equations using the following methods:
    - Euler;
    - Inverse Euler;
    - Improved Euler;
    - Runge-Kutta;
    - Adam-Bashforth;
    - Adam-Multon;
    - Backward Differentiation;
  * Developed in Python3 language;

Statements:
* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZzVixoMKZFoYoxQcopg5EMDWU2e57xccHJjP9FWKw3U/edit

Imports:
* https://matplotlib.org/
  download: `pip install matplotlib`
* https://www.sympy.org/
  download: `pip install sympy`

Steps:
    
    * Write the equations obeying the formatting described in the statements "input.txt";
      - Avoid blank lines at the end of all cases;
      - A sample exists in this same repository;
    * Exectute in terminal 'python3 main.py';
    * The output will be directed to the file: output.txt;

Bonus:
  * Uncomment the [!!!] lines to display the chart using the matplotlib library;
  * Try higher orders in Adam-Bashforth, Adam-Multon methods;

enjoy-it ;)
